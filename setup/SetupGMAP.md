[GMAP](http://research-pub.gene.com/gmap/) stands for Genome Mapping and Alignment Program which aligns NGS data to the reference genome. The reference genomes are required to be set up in advance,
which is well explained in the section 3 and 4 in the [readme](http://research-pub.gene.com/gmap/src/README) file. In GIO, the data folder is determined to be at _galaxy-dist/tool-data/data_.
