BLAST could be the most-known tool. The detailed installation instruction can be found [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK52640/).
The BLAST-based gio tools will use the [configuration](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK52640/#_chapter1_Configuration_) for
BLAST to carry out the analyses. For the user's convenience, the executables are distributed with gio-repository which should work on many OS. The user only needs to make sure that the **.ncbirc** file points to the BLAST database folder.
The BLAST databases can either be directly
[downloaded](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK52640/#_chapter1__Basic_use_1_) or created by the **makeblastdb** command.
