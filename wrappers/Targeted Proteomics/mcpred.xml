	MC:pred (http://king.smith.man.ac.uk/mcpred/) is based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained on observed peptides in Peptide Atlas (S. cerevisiae, C. elegans and D. melanogaster). The output from the SVM approach produces a score for both the N and C terminus of a peptide ranging between 0-1. Increased potential for missed cleavages results in a higher score. A binary threshold of 0.5 can be applied to distinguish missed from cleaved sites. Increasing the threshold will increase the precision (PPV) of the missed cleavage prediction, but will sacrifice the recall (sensitivity). Predictions are provided for tryptic peptides of length >5.
