The tool is primarily designed for ProViral approach which utilizes two-steps to detect viruses in samples using signature peptides. It retrieves the numbers of identified peptides, proteins and protein groups for each species in the CSV result file generated by mzID:converter using exportProteinGroups option and order the species according to the number of identified protein groups and peptides. There are two types of proteins: signature and non-signature. For signatures, the proteins are filtered based on the ratio of detected peptides over detectable peptides (>10%). For non-signatures, the filtering is based on the number of supporting peptides (>1).
