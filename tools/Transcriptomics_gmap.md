**Name:** GMAP

**Description:**
align the DNA sequence to reference genome

**Input files:**
* The DNA sequence in fasta format

**Parameters:**
* Input name: species
**Outputs:**
* output in sam format

**Details:**

This tool maps and aligns the DNA sequence to the reference genome. The DNA sequence can be the result file from either TopHat or Trinity method. At the moment, we only provide Human hg19 reference genome, more will be added later. More details of the GMAP tool and examples can be found at http://research-pub.gene.com/gmap/. The result SAM file contains the information about where and how the DNA sequences align to the reference genome.
