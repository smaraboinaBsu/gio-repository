PREGO is a software tool that predicts high responding peptides for SRM 
experiments. PREGO predicts peptide responses with an artificial neural 
network trained using 11 minimally redundant, maximally relevant properties. 
Crucial to its success, PREGO is trained using fragment ion intensities of 
equimolar synthetic peptides extracted from data independent acquisition 
(DIA) experiments.


Command line usage:

Run PREGO on the tab delimitated text file albumin.txt:
> classify albumin.txt

Run PREGO on the FASTA file example_proteins.fasta:
> classify -f example_proteins.fasta

Redirect standard output report to a file report.txt:
> classify -f -r report.txt example_proteins.fasta


Command line options:
	-f	(Optional) Files are in FASTA format. Proteins will be 
		tryptically digested and peptides >25 or <8 will be 
		discarded.

	-p	(Optional) Files only have peptide sequences, not protein 
		accessions. This argument must be used first if specified.

	-nn [file.nn]	(Optional) Use alternate neural network file 
		generated by BuildClassifier. This argument must be used 
		before the files are specified.

	-r [report.txt]	(Optional) Use alternate report file. This argument 
		must be used before the files are specified.

	[file.txt]...	Specifies one or more input text files of protein 
		accessions and peptide sequences where each protein/sequence 
		pair is a tab deliminated row.
